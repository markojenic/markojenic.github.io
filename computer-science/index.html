            <p>Week 0 - Starting from scratch.</p>
            <p>Your assignment, quite simply, is to implement in Scratch, at <a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">scratch.mit.edu</a>, any project of your choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:</span></p>
            <ul class="fa-ul">
            <li data-marker="*">Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.</li>
            <li data-marker="*">Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).</li>
            <li data-marker="*">Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.</li>
            <li data-marker="*">Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via&nbsp;<strong>Make a Block</strong>), which must take at least one input.</li>
            <li data-marker="*">Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than&nbsp;<a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277537196">Oscartime</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326129433">Ivy&rsquo;s Hardest Game</a>.</li>

            </div>
            <p>As this was my first assignment, I felt compelled to create a project purely from my own ideas, without external inspiration, and make something personally enjoyable.</p> 
            <p>My inspiration came from a mini-game in FIFA 06 on PSP, a game I played tirelessly when I was 13 years old. This mini-game, along with the 'Ronaldinho Joga Bonito' campaign videos by Nike Football, inspired me to spend all my free time practicing the kick-up skills shown.</p> 
            <p>The game required you to rotate the PSP and play it vertically, using the arrow keys at the bottom. The screen would display a randomly generated arrow, which you had to press to successfully complete a kick-up. The more successful kick-ups made, the smaller the timing window for pressing keys became, increasing the challenge.</p>
            <p>Based on the available sprites in Scratch and their multiple costumes, I found that the dinosaur best represented the movements needed for my actions. The costume options included variations with his tail raised and resting. When alternated, these created a fluid motion of the tail kicking up and down. Thus, the name 'Ronal-dino' both a homage to a personal touch and a fitting application of the available sprites.</p>
            <p>What's more, Scratch already had a Copacabana beach background; the only external element I imported was the music to complete the theme audibly.</p>
            <p>Although my project demanded a much more complex script than the assignment required, it was an incredibly enjoyable task and served as a valuable introduction to thinking critically in code.</p>
